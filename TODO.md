## Implementation Method Used (Final Approach)

### Hybrid WordPress-Native Approach
Instead of converting React components directly, we implemented a **WordPress-native hybrid approach**:

1. **Vanilla JavaScript Classes**: Created `ZestraDashboard` class that mimics React component patterns
2. **WordPress AJAX Integration**: Used WordPress AJAX system instead of REST API for better security
3. **Unified Data Fetching**: `ZC_DMT_Indicators::get_data_by_slug()` supports both DB and live data sources
4. **Cache-Busting Asset Loading**: Used `filemtime()` for automatic cache invalidation
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Dashboard gracefully falls back through available indicators
6. **Single Comparison Model**: Simplified to 1 comparison (like working reference) instead of complex multi-comparison

### Key Technical Decisions:
- **No React Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JS for better WordPress compatibility
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Used CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Nonce-Based Security**: All AJAX calls use WordPress nonces
- **Responsive-First Design**: Mobile-optimized from the start
- **Graceful Degradation**: Charts work even if some features fail
